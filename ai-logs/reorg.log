3. Path Alias Structure:
   - `@/*` -> `src/*`
   - `@components/*` -> `src/components/*`
   - `@layouts/*` -> `src/layouts/*`
   - `@lib/*` -> `src/lib/*`
   - `@types/*` -> `src/types/*`
   - `@utils/*` -> `src/utils/*`
   - `@content/*` -> `src/content/*`
   - `@config/*` -> `src/config/*`
   - `@scripts/*` -> `scripts/*`
   - `@types/printful/*` -> `src/types/printful/*`
   - `@types/database/*` -> `src/types/database/*`
   - `@types/api/*` -> `src/types/api/*`
   - `@types/common/*` -> `src/types/common/*`

4. Next Steps:
   - Update all files to use path aliases
   - Remove relative path imports
   - Fix any remaining import issues
   - Update build configuration to support path aliases

### 2024-03-22 - Import Path Issues
Found several categories of import path issues that need to be fixed:

1. Relative Path Issues:
   - Many files using relative paths (../) instead of path aliases
   - Common in pages, components, and API routes
   - Example: `import MainLayout from '../layouts/MainLayout.astro'`

2. Inconsistent Auth Imports:
   - Some files using `utils/auth`
   - Others using `utils/auth-fixed`
   - Need to standardize on `@lib/auth`

3. Supabase Client Imports:
   - Inconsistent paths: `lib/supabase` vs `lib/supabase/client`
   - Should standardize on `@lib/supabase/client`

4. Type Imports:
   - Some using relative paths for types
   - Should use `@types` alias instead
