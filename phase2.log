# Phase 2 Progress Log

## Completed Tasks
1. Created basic product sync functionality
   - Fetches products from Printful
   - Stores in Supabase database
   - Handles variants
   - Tracks sync history

2. Implemented product edit page
   - Read-only display of Printful data

   - Basic form validation

3. Fixed sync logic
   - Now properly updates existing products instead of creating duplicates
   - Handles variant updates correctly
   - Tracks changes in printful_product_changes table

## Current Status
- Basic product management is working
- Sync process is stable
- Edit page needs configuration section

## Next Steps

### 1. Database Schema Updates Needed
- Create `atrocitee_categories` table
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE atrocitee_categories (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
  );
  ```

- Create `atrocitee_tags` table for standardized tags
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE atrocitee_tags (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
  );
  ```

- Add foreign key to products table for charity
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE products
  ADD COLUMN atrocitee_charity_id UUID REFERENCES charities(id);
  ```

### 2. Configuration Page Requirements
- Create `/admin/products/configure/[id]` page
- Fields to configure:
  - Category selection (from atrocitee_categories)
  - Tag management (combo of predefined tags and custom tags)
  - Charity selection (from charities table)
  - Featured status
  - Active status
  - Custom metadata fields

### 3. UI/UX Improvements Needed
- Add success/error notifications
- Add confirmation dialogs for important actions
- Add loading states during sync
- Add pagination for large product lists
- Add search/filter functionality

### 4. Testing Required
- Test sync with large product catalogs
- Test variant updates
- Test category/tag management
- Test charity assignment
- Test error handling

## Questions to Resolve
1. Should we allow custom categories or only use predefined ones?
2. How should we handle tag standardization?
3. Do we need to track tag usage statistics?
4. Should we add validation for charity assignments?
5. Do we need to add any additional metadata fields?

## Technical Debt
1. Add proper error handling for API failures
2. Add retry logic for failed syncs
3. Add logging for debugging
4. Add data validation
5. Add proper TypeScript types for all database tables

## Security Considerations
1. Ensure proper access control for configuration page
2. Validate all user inputs
3. Sanitize data before display
4. Add rate limiting for sync operations
5. Add audit logging for configuration changes
