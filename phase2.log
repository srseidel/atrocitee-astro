3. Test form submission with various category selections
4. Verify error handling for invalid category IDs

[2024-03-22] Category System Status Update
### Current Status
- ✅ Single source of truth established with atrocitee_categories table
- ✅ Core categories defined with proper UUIDs
- ✅ Product configuration using correct category IDs
- ✅ Basic category API endpoints standardized
- ✅ Old category endpoints already moved to archive
- ✅ All category field names standardized to atrocitee_category_id

### Remaining Tasks
1. Verify category sync process:
   - Test category synchronization with new endpoints
   - Ensure Printful category mapping uses standardized endpoints
   - Verify category updates in product sync process

### Next Steps
1. Test category sync process
2. Update documentation with new category system

[2024-03-22] Category Endpoint Consolidation
### Files Modified
- Created new directory structure:
  - `/api/categories/index.ts` - Core category operations
  - `/api/categories/mapping.ts` - Category mapping operations
  - `/api/categories/sync.ts` - Sync operations

### Files Archived
- Moved to `/api/printful/archive/`:
  - `category-mapping.ts`
  - `sync-categories.ts`
- Moved to `/api/archive/`:
  - `categories.ts`

### Impact
- Consolidated all category-related endpoints under a single directory
- Maintained clear separation between core and Printful operations
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Reduced duplication in error handling and auth checks

### Testing Steps
1. Verify all endpoints are accessible:
   - GET /api/categories - List all categories
   - POST /api/categories - Create/update category
   - GET /api/categories/mapping - List category mappings
   - POST /api/categories/mapping - Create/update mapping
   - DELETE /api/categories/mapping - Delete mapping
   - POST /api/categories/sync - Sync Printful categories

2. Test admin access:
   - Verify all endpoints require admin access
   - Test unauthorized access is blocked

3. Test error handling:
   - Verify proper error messages for invalid data
   - Check error logging is working

4. Test category sync:
   - Verify Printful categories are synced correctly
   - Check mapping functionality works
   - Verify category updates in products

[2024-03-22] Category Endpoint Location Correction
### Files Moved
- Moved category endpoints to correct admin location:
  - `/api/admin/categories/index.ts` - Core category operations
  - `/api/admin/categories/mapping.ts` - Category mapping operations
  - `/api/admin/categories/sync.ts` - Sync operations

### Impact
- Aligns with architecture rules for admin-protected endpoints
- Improves security by clearly indicating admin-only routes
- Maintains consistency with other admin endpoints
- Better organization of protected vs public endpoints

### Testing Steps
1. Verify all endpoints are accessible under new paths:
   - GET /api/admin/categories - List all categories
   - POST /api/admin/categories - Create/update category
   - GET /api/admin/categories/mapping - List category mappings
   - POST /api/admin/categories/mapping - Create/update mapping
   - DELETE /api/admin/categories/mapping - Delete mapping
   - POST /api/admin/categories/sync - Sync Printful categories

2. Test admin access:
   - Verify all endpoints require admin access
   - Test unauthorized access is blocked
   - Verify middleware properly protects new paths
