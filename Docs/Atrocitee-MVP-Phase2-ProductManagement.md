- [ ] Create product data transformation functions
- [ ] Implement image handling and optimization
- [ ] Set up scheduled synchronization process
- [ ] Create sync history and logging

### 3. Product Versioning System

**Objective**: Implement the Flag & Review versioning system for products.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create database structures for tracking product changes
- [ ] Implement version tracking fields in product schema
- [ ] Build comparison engine for product changes
- [ ] Create change categorization (critical vs. standard)
- [ ] Develop admin interface for reviewing changes
- [ ] Implement selective change application functionality
- [ ] Create audit logs for product updates
- [ ] Build version history view

### 4. Admin Product Management

**Objective**: Create interfaces for managing products and their Atrocitee-specific data.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Develop admin product listing interface
- [ ] Create product detail/edit view
- [ ] Implement Atrocitee-specific field management:
  - [ ] Donation amount configuration
  - [ ] Tag management system
  - [ ] Published/unpublished status control
- [ ] Build bulk operations interface
- [ ] Implement product search and filtering
- [ ] Create product image management
- [ ] Develop variant display and management
- [ ] Build product preview functionality

### 5. Category Management

**Objective**: Create a system for organizing products into navigable categories.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement category creation interface
- [ ] Build category hierarchy management
- [ ] Create product-to-category assignment interface
- [ ] Develop category listing and navigation components
- [ ] Implement category filtering on product listings
- [ ] Create category metadata management (descriptions, images)
- [ ] Build category-based URLs and routing
- [ ] Implement category sorting and ordering

### 6. Customer-Facing Product Display

**Objective**: Create public-facing product browsing experience.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Build product listing page with filtering
- [ ] Create individual product detail page
- [ ] Implement product variant selection interface
- [ ] Build product image gallery
- [ ] Create product metadata display (donation amount, etc.)
- [ ] Implement product recommendations component
- [ ] Build category navigation for customers
- [ ] Create breadcrumb navigation

### 7. Search and Discovery

**Objective**: Implement product search and discovery features.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create basic product search functionality
- [ ] Implement tag-based filtering
- [ ] Build featured product display components
- [ ] Create sorting options (newest, price, etc.)
- [ ] Implement pagination for product listings
- [ ] Develop filter persistence across sessions
- [ ] Create product collection displays (curated sets)
- [ ] Build URL structure for filtered views

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Webhooks properly receive and process notifications
- [ ] Synchronization process correctly identifies changed products

### Product Versioning
- [ ] Product changes are detected and categorized
- [ ] Admin can review side-by-side comparisons of changes
- [ ] Selective application of changes is functional
- [ ] Version history is properly maintained

### Product Management
- [ ] Administrators can add Atrocitee-specific fields to products
- [ ] Products can be published/unpublished
- [ ] Donation amounts can be set per product
- [ ] Tags can be assigned to products
- [ ] Product variants are correctly displayed and managed

### Category System
- [ ] Categories can be created and managed
- [ ] Products can be assigned to categories
- [ ] Category browsing works for customers
- [ ] Category filtering is functional

### Customer Experience
- [ ] Product listings display correctly with proper information
- [ ] Product detail pages show all necessary information
- [ ] Variant selection is intuitive and functional
- [ ] Product search works correctly
- [ ] Category navigation is intuitive

## Dependencies and Considerations

- **Printful API Limitations**: Be mindful of API rate limits during implementation
- **Image Handling**: Consider image optimization and caching for performance
- **Product Data Volume**: Ensure database and queries are optimized for potentially large product catalogs
- **Category Flexibility**: Design category system to be adaptable for future expansion
- **Product Variations**: T-shirt sizes/colors must be handled correctly even with simplified schema

## Success Criteria

Phase 2 will be considered complete when:
1. Administrators can import products from Printful
2. Product changes from Printful are properly detected and can be managed
3. Categories can be created and products assigned to them
4. Customers can browse products by category
5. Product detail pages show all necessary information including variants
6. All completion checklist items are verified as complete
