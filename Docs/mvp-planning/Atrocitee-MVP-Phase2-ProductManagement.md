# Atrocitee MVP - Phase 2: Product Management

## Overview
Phase 2 focuses on implementing the product management system, including Printful integration, product synchronization, and category management. This phase will enable the importing of products from Printful and the management of product data within the Atrocitee platform.

## Focus Areas

### 1. Printful API Integration

**Objective**: Establish secure, reliable connectivity with the Printful API.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [x] Create Printful API credentials and configuration
- [x] Implement API client with retry and error handling
- [x] Set up secure storage of API keys in environment variables
- [x] Create rate limiting and request throttling mechanisms
- [x] Implement logging for API interactions
- [x] Build abstraction layer for Printful API operations
- [ ] Create webhook endpoint for Printful notifications
- [ ] Implement webhook signature verification

### 2. Product Import and Synchronization

**Objective**: Enable importing products from Printful and keeping them in sync.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [x] Create initial product import functionality
- [x] Implement synchronization process for product updates
- [x] Build product filtering and selection interface (for admin)
- [x] Develop change detection system for product updates
- [x] Create product data transformation functions
- [x] Implement image handling and optimization
- [ ] Set up scheduled synchronization process
- [x] Create sync history and logging

### 3. Product Versioning System

**Objective**: Implement the Flag & Review versioning system for products.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [x] Create database structures for tracking product changes
- [x] Implement version tracking fields in product schema
- [x] Build comparison engine for product changes
- [x] Create change categorization (critical vs. standard)
- [x] Develop admin interface for reviewing changes
- [x] Implement selective change application functionality
- [ ] Create audit logs for product updates
- [ ] Build version history view

### 4. Admin Product Management

**Objective**: Create interfaces for managing products and their Atrocitee-specific data.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [x] Develop admin product listing interface
- [x] Create product detail/edit view
- [ ] Implement Atrocitee-specific field management:
  - [ ] Donation amount configuration
  - [x] Tag management system
  - [ ] Published/unpublished status control
- [ ] Build bulk operations interface
- [x] Implement product search and filtering
- [x] Create product image management
- [x] Develop variant display and management
- [ ] Build product preview functionality

### 5. Category Management

**Objective**: Create a system for organizing products into navigable categories with Printful integration.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [x] Implement category creation interface
- [ ] Build category hierarchy management
- [x] Create product-to-category assignment interface
- [x] Develop category listing and navigation components
- [x] Implement category filtering on product listings
- [x] Create Printful category synchronization
- [x] Build Printful-to-Atrocitee category mapping system
- [ ] Implement tag management for more granular product organization
- [ ] Create category metadata management (descriptions, images)
- [ ] Build category-based URLs and routing
- [ ] Implement category sorting and ordering

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Categories provide broad product organization (e.g., "T-Shirts", "Hoodies")
- Tags will complement categories for more specific filtering (e.g., "Political", "Environmental")
- Printful categories are synchronized on-demand and mapped to Atrocitee categories
- Newly imported products can be automatically assigned to categories based on mappings
- Category mapping table enables flexibility in how Printful and Atrocitee taxonomies relate
- Admin interface provides visual tools for category mapping management

### 6. Customer-Facing Product Display

**Objective**: Create public-facing product browsing experience.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Build product listing page with filtering
- [ ] Create individual product detail page
- [ ] Implement product variant selection interface
- [ ] Build product image gallery
- [ ] Create product metadata display (donation amount, etc.)
- [ ] Implement product recommendations component
- [ ] Build category navigation for customers
- [ ] Create breadcrumb navigation

### 7. Search and Discovery

**Objective**: Implement product search and discovery features.

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Create basic product search functionality
- [ ] Implement tag-based filtering
- [ ] Build featured product display components
- [ ] Create sorting options (newest, price, etc.)
- [ ] Implement pagination for product listings
- [ ] Develop filter persistence across sessions
- [ ] Create product collection displays (curated sets)
- [ ] Build URL structure for filtered views

## Completion Checklist

### Printful Integration
- [x] API connection successfully established and tested

- [x] Selective application of changes is functional
- [x] Version history is properly maintained

### Product Management
- [ ] Administrators can add Atrocitee-specific fields to products
- [ ] Products can be published/unpublished
- [ ] Donation amounts can be set per product
- [x] Tags can be assigned to products
- [x] Product variants are correctly displayed and managed

### Category System
- [x] Categories can be created and managed
- [x] Products can be assigned to categories
- [x] Printful categories can be mapped to Atrocitee categories
- [ ] Category browsing works for customers
- [x] Category filtering is functional

### Customer Experience
- [ ] Product listings display correctly with proper information
- [ ] Product detail pages show all necessary information
- [ ] Variant selection is intuitive and functional
- [ ] Product search works correctly
- [ ] Category navigation is intuitive

## Dependencies and Considerations

- **Printful API Limitations**: Be mindful of API rate limits during implementation
- **Image Handling**: Consider image optimization and caching for performance
- **Product Data Volume**: Ensure database and queries are optimized for potentially large product catalogs
- **Category Flexibility**: Design category system to be adaptable for future expansion
- **Product Variations**: T-shirt sizes/colors must be handled correctly even with simplified schema

## Success Criteria

1. Administrators can import products from Printful
2. Product changes from Printful are properly detected and can be managed
3. Categories can be created and products assigned to them
4. Customers can browse products by category
5. Product detail pages show all necessary information including variants
6. All completion checklist items are verified as complete
