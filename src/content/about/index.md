## Our Mission

Atrocitee was founded with a simple but powerful mission: to create a platform where political expression through fashion directly supports the causes we care about. We believe in the power of wearing your values and backing them up with real action.

Every t-shirt in our collection is designed to spark conversations and raise awareness about important political and social issues. More importantly, each purchase directly contributes to organizations working on these causes.

## How We Support Causes

We partner with vetted non-profit organizations that are making tangible impacts in their fields. A portion of every sale (typically 10-20% depending on the product) goes directly to the charity associated with that design.

Our donation process is transparent, and we regularly publish reports on the total amounts donated to each cause.

## Our Values

**Transparency:** We're open about our costs, donations, and operations.

**Quality:** Our products are ethically manufactured and built to last.

**Impact:** We measure success by the tangible change we help create.

**Conversation:** We believe in the power of dialogue to drive progress.
