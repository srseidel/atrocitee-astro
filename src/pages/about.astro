      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Atrocitee was founded with a simple but powerful mission: to create a platform where political expression through fashion directly supports the causes we care about. We believe in the power of wearing your values and backing them up with real action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every t-shirt in our collection is designed to spark conversations and raise awareness about important political and social issues. More importantly, each purchase directly contributes to organizations working on these causes.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Support Causes</h2>
      <p>
        We partner with vetted non-profit organizations that are making tangible impacts in their fields. A portion of every sale (typically 10-20% depending on the product) goes directly to the charity associated with that design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our donation process is transparent, and we regularly publish reports on the total amounts donated to each cause.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> We're open about our costs, donations, and operations.</p>
      <p><strong>Quality:</strong> Our products are ethically manufactured and built to last.</p>
      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> We measure success by the tangible change we help create.</p>
      <p><strong>Conversation:</strong> We believe in the power of dialogue to drive progress.</p>

      <h2 id="impact">Our Impact</h2>
